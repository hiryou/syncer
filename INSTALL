INSTALLATION
------------
Please consult README prior to this installation guide

1. Copy this folder to your path of choice. This document will assume it is 
~/scripts/syncer.linux/

2. Add an alias referencing syncer2.0.sh to your ~/.bash_aliases (or .profile, 
.zsh_profile, etc depending on your shell)
    alias SYNC2="bash ~/scripts/syncer.linux/syncer2.0.sh"
    
3. Open syncer2.0.sh and fill in your credentials at the header of the file. Below is an example:
    USERNAME="hiryou"
    REMOTEHOST="68.215.56.87"       # experiences show that host IP works better than host name
    REMOTEDIR="/usr/local/dev_box/"
    EXCLUDED=".git .svn .tmp"
    
    * Any directory will be synced as a direct child of the $REMOTEDIR in $REMOTEHOST.
    
4. Restart your shell and you should be good to go
    $ source ~/.bash_aliases
